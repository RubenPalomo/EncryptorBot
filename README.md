Bot for telegram that allows you to encrypt messages and decrypt them later through the use of a password. It uses the AES encryption.
<br />
The bot commands are as follows:
1. To encrypt a message you use **/encrypt** + the password you want to use + the message you want to encrypt (separated from each other by spaces).
2. To decrypt a message use **/decrypt** + the password used to encrypt the message while replying to the encrypted message.
3. You can also decrypt the message using the same formula of **/decrypt** + password but adding the encrypted message afterwards.
